# Summit

GEOSummit is a NSF-funded research station near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, with many instruments from different labs. These analyses and realtime processing concern the Atmospheric Research Lab's ongoing project at GEOSummit for the measurement of trace gases (CO, CO2, Methane [CH4], and volatile organic chemicals [VOCs]).
