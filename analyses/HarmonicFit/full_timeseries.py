This script explores the ratio of ethane to methane, as well as acetylene to methane. It plots the ratio
along all of the years where the data is present, and then performs harmonic fitting on the plots.

Goals:
1) Import ratio data
2) Create timeseries of ratio data
3) Perform harmonic fit on the data
4) Identify regions of large residual
