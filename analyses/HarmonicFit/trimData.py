"""
Created on Friday May 24th

This script imports data from current updated Methane and VOC spreadsheets, combines them with past data,
and optimizes them for usage in the NOAA Python CCG Harmonic Fitting Program, then outputs them to a text file.

This script returns the data specifically in the form optimized for the CCG Harmonic Fitting Program: a text file
with two columns of numbers, the first column is a decimal year value, and the second column is the corresponding
value, columns are separated just by white space

Currently, a few data cleaning tactics are employed. First, since there is no methane data past 2012, the VOC data
before 2012 is cut. We only look at ethane and acetylene in this circumstance, so other VOC columns are removed. Any
row with a NaN value is completely dropped. Since methane is sampled more frequently than the VOC's, methane values
from +/- three hours from any given VOC data point are averaged and then used to calculate the ratio of VOC / ch4 at
any given VOC datapoint timestep.
