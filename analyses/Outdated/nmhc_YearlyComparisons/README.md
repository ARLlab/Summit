## [OUTDATED] This folder contains analyses on the NHMC's across all years of data. 
  The outputted plots express individual NMHC compounds over the span of a single year.
  Each plot has a seperate line for each year of data
  
  ## Goals:
1) Times on the x axis should be written as day of the year instead of decimal
2) Each plot should have a proper legend
3) Remove outliers from the data sets
4) [Maybe?] Put each compound graph in one larger subplot for trend comparison
5) Modularize code to have an input / sort matrices file, and then a plotting file
