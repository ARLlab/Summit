Created on Thursday, March 7th, 2019.

This script serves to create plots of each of the NMHC compounds
over the course of 365 days. Each year of data is plotted as a separate line.

Goals:
1) Times on the x axis should be written as day of the year instead of decimal
2) Each plot should have a proper legend
3) Remove outliers from the data sets
4) [Maybe?] Put each compound graph in one larger subplot for trend comparison
