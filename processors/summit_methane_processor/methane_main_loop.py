"""
Methane has only CH4.LOG, and per-run logs. The .LOG file contains date / peaks (name, peak area, retention time)
This just needs to be read in, parsed for new dates/lines, then those lines need to be parsed for peaks, and
sample peaks need to be quantified on the standard peaks.

The per-run logs contain sample pressures, etc; those are associated with pairs of two runs.

Some runtime QC is needed to prevent quantification from failed standard runs, poor integrations, etc.
