"""
This will be the main script for all processing.

TODO: Some random counter variables and such are not stored in DB, those should go to config tables per processor

_______Things that need config/DB Storage:
Best way to do this? ORM seems overpowered and possibly not helpful?

VOCs:
pa_file_size: bytesize of the pa file to determine if it's newer
start_line: line to start reading from; saves rejecting thousands of already-in-db lines later
data_len: Length of data for VOC plotting to determine new data; should be changed to most recent data date instead
days_to_plot:

CH4:
start_size, start_line: bytesize of the PA file and line to start reading from
data_len: Length of data for VOC plotting to determine new data; should be changed to most recent data date instead
days_to_plot:

Picarro:
days_to_plot:
date_ago: this even used?
last_data_point: should be date
