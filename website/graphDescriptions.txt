Title: Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Volatile Organic Compounds
  at GEOSummit in Greenland

    This site presents preliminary results of atmospheric near-real time monitoring
    at GEOSummit in Greenland. The monitoring is conducted by researchers at the
    Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at the University of Colorado.
    Atmospheric data is gathered from a Picarro instrument and from a GC-FID instrument.

Methane (CH4) During the Past Three Days

  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It has an atmospheric lifetime of about a decade
  and is distributed globally. Methane emissions in this region mainly come from ...

  This graph presents methane amounts gathered from both the Picarro instrument
  and the GC-FID instrument. Each instruments data is displayed separately, and
  then overlayed on the same graph. The times are reported in Mountain Standard
  Time (MST). Data during Daylight Savings Time (March-November) will have to be
  corrected by adding one hour.

  Methane data is monitored by loop injection of 10 ml samples and gas chromatography
  with flame ionization detection from the GC-FID instrument. The samples are collected
  at 20-minute intervals. The Picarro instrument ...

Selected Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) During the Past Three Days

  The VOC's are monitored by preconcentration of 500 ml-samples onto a micro-adsorbent trap,
  with subsequent thermal desorption, capillary column gas chromatography separation,
  and flame ionization detection. Samples are collected at 2-hour intervals.

  Ethane / Propane
  Butane Isomers, Acetylene
  Pentane Isomers
  Benzene / Toluene
